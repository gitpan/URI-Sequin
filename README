  [S]earch   [E]ngine   [Q]uery   [U]rl   [I]nformation   [N]oter
           Version 1.2 by Peter Sergeant (01-09-03)

                  ( great tasting new formula! ) 

SEQUIN is intended to extract the keywords used and the name of a
search engine given the a line from a logfile that contains a
referal URL from a Search Engine which GETs its data.

Unlike traditional applications for doing this, it does not rely
on a preset list of search engines and thus currently works with
almost every search engine URL the author could get his hands on.

Comments are appreciated - if you find a search engine with which
it does not work, I would be truly fascinated.
