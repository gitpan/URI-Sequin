  [S]earch   [E]ngine   [Q]uery   [U]rl   [I]nformation   [N]oter
           Version 1.1 by Peter Sergeant (29-10-01)

              ( reconsituted for your pleasure )

SEQUIN is intended to extract the keywords used and the name of a
search engine given the a line from a logfile that contains a
referal URL from a Search Engine which GETs its data.

Unlike traditional applications for doing this, it does not rely
on a preset list of search engines and thus currently works with
almost every search engine URL the author could get his hands on.

Comments are appreciated - if you find a search engine with which
it does not work, I would be truly fascinated. Stay happy and 
keep drinking coffee.

Included:
=-=-=-=-=
	README           - This file
	CHANGES          - List of changes through revisions
	LICENSE	         - A copy of the GPL
	MANIFEST         - A list of what's included to keep MAKE happy
	Sequin.pm  	 - The module itselfy
	Example.pl 	 - Some working code to play with
	Makefile.pl      - What we make the makefile with
	Test.pl		 - A test file to keep MAKE happy
	ref1.log	 - Some sample URLs to play with
	ref2.log	 - Some logfile lines to play with

I seem to remember in my Windows days becoming very upset that I
could never install modules easily, due to a lack of a decent
make program. To install this module is easy on Windows. Go to
the Perl installation directory, and find lib/URI or /lib/site/URI
or site/lib/URI (any will do, just find one that exists) and copy
the Sequin.pm file over.

If you have any questions, the author can be emailed, at
pete@grou.ch or is often sighted on EFNet or MAGNet as sheriff_p.


And now for something completely different, and very dull:
