#
# 
# The purpose of this subroutine is to allow raw log files lines to be
# handled. The subroutine accepts a log line, plus some information on
# how it should be analysed, and returns a scalar value: the referring
# URL.
#
# The subroutine knows a certain number of log types, and keeps regexs
# with which to handle these logs in a globally accessable hash below,
# called '%log_types'. If your log type is not already in the array it
# can be added and used.
#
# Examples:
# ---------
#
# Adding a new regex to %log_types:
# => $log_types{'MyWebServer'} = '.+? Referer:(.+?) ';
#
#	> It's worth pointing out that the subroutine uses $1 straight
#	> after the match has taken place to get the referrer. Because
#	> of this, you should make sure the part of string to be taken
#	> is enclosed in ()'s. If you're still unsure, this is clearly
#	> demonstrated below, where %log_types is set.
# 
# Parsing a Log Entry
# => $referrer = &log_extract($log_line, 'NCSA');
#
#	> As I hope is clear, $log_line is the log-file line that needs
#	> to be parsed, and 'Apache' refers to the relevant regex below
#	> in the %log_types hash.

=head1 NAME

URI::Sequin - Extract information from the URLs of Search-Engines

=head1 SYNOPSIS


	use URI::Sequin qw/se_extract key_extract log_extract %log_types/;

	$url = &log_extract($line_from_log_file, 'NCSA');

	$log_types{'MyLogType'} = '^(.+?) -> .+$';
	$url = &log_extract($line_from_log_file, 'MyLogType');

	$keyword_string = &key_extract($url);

	($search_engine_name, $search_engine_url) = @{&se_extract($url)};


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides three tools to aid people trying to analyse
Search-Engine URLs. It’s meant mainly for those who want to analyse
referrer logs and pick out key information about site visitors, such as
which Search-Engine and keywords they used to find the site.

The functions and globals provided (and exported by default) from this
module are:

=over

=item log_extract($log_line, 'Type')

This will pick out the referring URL from a line of a logfile. The 'type' can
be one of the built in types or can be a user-created one. For more
information, see %log_types below. This subroutine accepts a scalar, and
returns a scalar.

=item key_extract($url)

This will try and determine the keywords used in $url. It accepts a scalar
and returns a scalar. Should nothing be found, it returns an undefined value.

=item se_extract($url)

This will try and determine the name of the Search-Engine used and its URL.
It accepts a scalar, and returns an array containing firstly the Search-
Engine’s name and secondly the Search-Engine’s URL. Should the URL appear not
to be from a Search Query, it returns a reference to an empty array.

=item %log_types

There are five built-in logfile types already in this hash. They are:

=over 4

=item * IIS1 - Microsoft IIS 3.0 and 2.0

=item * IIS2 - Microsoft IIS4.0 (W3SVC format)

=item * NCSA - For APACHE, NETSCAPE and any other NCSA format logs

=item * ORW - O'Reilly WebSite format

=item * General - A generalised one that will work with most logfiles

=back

It’s easy to add another one. Simply add a key to the hash, with a value that
is a regex. Parenthesise the part that is the referring URL, as the script
uses $1 to obtain the URL. (see the example in the Synopsis section).

I have only one request for people who use this module. *Please* tell me where
and how you've used it, and if you have any thoughts or suggestions on it, tell
me!

=back

=head1 BUGS

Doesn't like the Amnesi Search Engine. But then, neither do I. Also,
the 'General' log type needs to be used with discretion ... be sure
that none of the URLs contain literal " if you use it.
